# Reinforcement-Learning

**Reinforcement learning** (RL) is a type of machine learning process that focuses on decision making by autonomous agents. An autonomous agent is any system that can make decisions and act in response to its environment independent of direct instruction by a human user. In reinforcement learning, an autonomous agent learns to perform a task by trial and error in the absence of any guidance from a human user.

**Autonomous Driving** has long been considered a field in which Reinforcement algorithms excel, and this project aims to leverage the power of RL to create an intelligent agent that can solve the Farama’s foundation “highway-env” project, namely the **Highway environment** (refer to https://highwayenv.farama.org/environments/highway/)
